# Fibonacci Series Practice in Java

This repository contains Java programs to work with the Fibonacci series, demonstrating various methods and techniques for generating and manipulating Fibonacci numbers.

## Programs

### 1. Basic Fibonacci Series

This program prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series, where `n` is provided by the user.

**Usage:**
- Run the program.
- Input the value of `n` when prompted.
- The program will print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

**Example Output:**
Enter the number of terms: 10 Fibonacci Series up to 10 terms: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34.

### 2. Fibonacci Series with Sum

This program calculates and prints the sum of the first `n` terms in the Fibonacci series.

**Usage:**
- Run the program.
- Input the value of `n` when prompted.
- The program will print the sum of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

**Example Output:**
Enter the number of terms: 5 Sum of the first 5 terms is: 12.

### 3. Fibonacci Series Using Recursion

This program generates the Fibonacci series using a recursive method.

**Usage:**
- Run the program.
- Input the value of `n` when prompted.
- The program will use recursion to print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

**Example Output:**
Enter the number of terms: 7 Fibonacci Series up to 7 terms: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

### 4. Fibonacci Series in a Range

This program prints all Fibonacci numbers that fall within a given range (e.g., between 10 and 100).

**Usage:**
- Run the program.
- Input the range (start and end values) when prompted.
- The program will print Fibonacci numbers within the specified range.

**Example Output:**
Enter the start of range: 10 Enter the end of range: 100 Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 100: 13 21 34 55 89
